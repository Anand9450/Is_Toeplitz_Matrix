# Is_Toeplitz_Matrix
A Toeplitz matrix is a type of matrix in which each descending diagonal from left to right is constant, meaning all elements on a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right are the same.
<br><br>
<b>Properties of a Toeplitz Matrix:</b>
<br>
1. Constant Diagonals: Each diagonal has the same value.<br>
2. Memory Efficiency: Since the values on each diagonal are the same, only one value per diagonal needs to be stored, leading to reduced memory usage.<br>
3. Applications: Toeplitz matrices appear in various applications, including signal processing, image processing, and solving certain types of linear systems efficiently.
